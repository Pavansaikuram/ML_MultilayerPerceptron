# ML_MultilayerPerceptron
•Developed a Multilayer perceptron neural network without using libraries and observed change in loss function by training and testing the network using the MNIST database.

•Implemented using Python, sigmoid as activation function, applied regularization techniques like ridge regression, and LASSO regression then plotted a graph using loss function and Epoch.
